# C-projects
I'm currently learning C programming language, so I'm posting things that I try here. Watch stepping up !

- Rand numb : This program generates random numbers from 1 to 9, numbers are printed as ANSCII art. You can change parameters such as number of iterations, or time between each iteration in the defined zone.
Made to work on your divided attention : To do mental calculation while doing sports.

- Learn mental calculation - IN FRENCH : In this program, you'll be able to learn mental calculation easily from 10x10 to 20x20.
I'll probably make a second version in English.

- Bruteforce letters : This programme makes you chose between any combination of 3 characters, and will try every combination to find yours.

- Bruteforce numbers : That's an alternative version of "bruteforce_lettres.c", to "bruteforce" or rather in this case enumerate numbers from 1 to 5 following.
